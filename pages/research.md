My research interests include 
-   Extreme Value Modeling
-   Spatial and Spatio-Temporal Modeling
-   Applications of Statistics to Climate and Environmental Science
-   Interactive Data Visualization

As part of the Stats MS program at OSU, I completed a research project studying the use of Univariate Extreme Value Analysis in modeling Extreme Precipitation Data. The project has its a [github page](https://github.com/MilesMoran/MS-Project-Oregon-EPEs) and a recording of the presentation of this project to my committee is embedded below.
