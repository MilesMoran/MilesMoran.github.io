# About

I'm Miles Moran! I was born and raised in Henderson, Nevada 

I currently attend the University of Nevada, Reno and expect to graduate May 2020 with a BSc in Applied Mathematics and a minor in Data Science. After a gap year, I'll be applying to graduate programs in Statistics. 

My research interests include statistical learning, pattern recognition, and mathematical modeling.
