As a TA at Oregon State, I've taught labs and developed course materials for several of the applied classes our department offers. So far, these include  

*   ST 351 - [INTRODUCTION TO STATISTICAL METHODS I](https://catalog.oregonstate.edu/search/?P=ST%20351)

*   ST 512 - [METHODS OF DATA ANALYSIS II](https://catalog.oregonstate.edu/search/?P=ST%20512) 

Starting in Fall of 2023, I'll be applying my knowledge as a Statistical Consultant for our department's [internal consulting service](https://stat.oregonstate.edu/services/statistical-consulting).
