Under the supervision of Rob Trangucci and Lisa Madsen, our research involves the use of selection-model methodology to make spatio-temporal epidemiology models robust to MNAR data.\nI work as a statistical consultant for OSU grad students, which has really fueled my passion for effective communication/education in statistics. Consulting is one of my responsibilities as the teaching assistant for our department’s consulting practicum course; but, I also get to advise other statisticians in their own consulting projects and develop course materials for them to use.\nAlthough I like to clear my head by hiking or rock climbing, I spend a lot of my free time playing strategy games and building with LEGO.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResearch Interests\n\nSpatial/Spatio-Temporal Models\nExtreme-Value Models\nStatistics in Climate Science\nStatistics in Epidemiology\nInteractive Data Visualization\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEducation\n\nPhD, Statistics (In Progress)\nOregon State University\nMS, Statistics (2023)\nOregon State University\nBS, Applied Mathematics (2020)\nUniversity of Nevada, Reno"
