As a graduate teaching assistant at OSU, I've taught labs and developed course materials for several of the applied classes our department offers. So far, these include  

* ST 351 - [INTRODUCTION TO STATISTICAL METHODS I](https://catalog.oregonstate.edu/search/?P=ST%20351) 
* ST 352 - [INTRODUCTION TO STATISTICAL METHODS II](https://catalog.oregonstate.edu/search/?P=ST%20352)
* ST 511 - [METHODS OF DATA ANALYSIS I](https://catalog.oregonstate.edu/search/?P=ST%20511)
* ST 512 - [METHODS OF DATA ANALYSIS II](https://catalog.oregonstate.edu/search/?P=ST%20512) 
* ST 509 - [CONSULTING PRACTICUM](https://catalog.oregonstate.edu/search/?P=ST%20509)

Since Fall of 2023, I've been applying my knowledge as a Statistical Consultant for our department's [internal consulting service](https://stat.oregonstate.edu/services/statistical-consulting).
